    "description": "...Chancellor? Can you hear me? Good.\n I must apologize for the abruptness, but there is no time for celebration. A Billion eyes turned toward youâ€”some in hope, some in fear. The burdens of our civilization rest upon your shoulders now, whether you are ready or not.\nThe reports are piling in already economic projections, military assessments, diplomatic briefings. You will make your first decisions soon, and they will set the tone for all that follows. Some will expect strength. Others, wisdom. But all will expect something.\nThe empire is not a well-oiled machine, ticking along in perfect harmony. No, Chancellor. It is a weak beast, small and wounded, held together by duty, ambition, and the sheer force of will of those who came before you.\nYou are no longer merely a person. You are an institution. A symbol. And in the coming days, you will learn what that truly means.\nThe question is, will we be able to adapt fast enough for the universe, and whatever it holds in store for us?",
